Indeed, m_x(cdot) is unbounded from below along the line eta_k + alpha delta_k. If our aim is to minimize the model within the trust-region, it makes far more sense to reduce m_x(cdot) along eta_k + alpha delta_k as much as we can while staying within the trust-region, and this means moving to the trust-region boundary along this line. Thus when kappa leqq 0 at iteration k, we replace alpha = fraclangle r_k z_k rangle_xkappa with tau described as above. The other possibility is that eta_k+1 would lie outside the trust-region at iteration k (i.e. langle eta_k eta_k rangle_x^*  geqq Delta^2 what can be identified with the norm of eta_k+1). In particular, when operatornameHessF (cdot)_ x is positive deﬁnite and eta_k+1 lies outside the trust region, the solution to the trust-region problem must lie on the trust-region boundary. Thus, there is no reason to continue with the conjugate gradient iteration, as it stands, as subsequent iterates will move further outside the trust-region boundary.
