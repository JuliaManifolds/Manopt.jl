Meanwhile, close to convergence, the       quadratic model should be a good fit and the steps should be       accepted. Regularization lets ρ go to 1 as the model decrease and       the actual decrease go to zero. Set this option to zero to disable       regularization (not recommended). When this is not zero, it may happen       that the iterates produced are not monotonically improving the cost       when very close to convergence.

The actual algorithm is split into an initialization phase, see initialize_solver!, and the implementation of the ith step of the solver itself, see  before the iterative procedure, see step_solver!. For these two functions, it would be great if a new algorithm uses functions from the ManifoldsBase.jl interface as generically as possible. For example, if possible use retract!(M,q,p,X) in favor of exp!(M,q,p,X) to perform a step starting in p in direction X (in place of q), since the exponential map might be too expensive to evaluate or might not be available on a certain manifold.

Note that since this method does not work in-place – these points are duplicated internally.\n\nThe aim of PSO is to find the particle position g on the Manifold M that solves\n\nmin_x mathcalM F(x)\n\nTo this end, a swarm of particles is moved around the Manifold M in the following manner. For every particle k we compute the new particle velocities v_k^(i) in every step i of the algorithm by\n\nv_k^(i) = ω  operatornameT_x_k^(i)gets x_k^(i-1)v_k^(i-1) + c   r_1  operatornameretr_x_k^(i)^-1(p_k^(i)) + s   r_2 operatornameretr_x_k^(i)^-1(g)\n\nwhere x_k^(i) is the current particle position, ω denotes the inertia, c and s are a cognitive and a social weight, respectively, r_j, j=12 are random factors which are computed new for each particle and step, operatornameretr^-1 denotes an inverse retraction on the Manifold M, and operatornameT is a vector transport.\n\nThen the position of the particle is updated as\n\nx_k^(i+1) = operatornameretr_x_k^(i)(v_k^(i))\n\nwhere operatornameretr denotes a retraction on the Manifold M. At the end of each step for every particle, we set\n\np_k^(i+1) = begincases\nx_k^(i+1)   textif  F(x_k^(i+1))F(p_k^(i))\np_k^(i)  textelse\nendcases\n\n\nand\n\ng_k^(i+1) =begincases\np_k^(i+1)   textif  F(p_k^(i+1))F(g_k^(i))\ng_k^(i)  textelse\nendcases\n\ni.e. p_k^(i) is the best known position for the particle k and g^(i) is the global best known position ever visited up to step i.\n\n[Borckmans2010]: P.

In this case, the model is not strictly convex, and the stepsize α =fracr_k z_k_x κ computed in step 1. does not give a reduction in the model function m_x(). Indeed, m_x() is unbounded from below along the line η_k + α δ_k. If our aim is to minimize the model within the trust-region, it makes far more sense to reduce m_x() along η_k + α δ_k as much as we can while staying within the trust-region, and this means moving to the trust-region boundary along this line. Thus, when κ  0 at iteration k, we replace α = fracr_k z_k_xκ with τ described as above. The other possibility is that η_k+1 would lie outside the trust-region at iteration k (i.e. η_k η_k_x^*   Δ^2 that can be identified with the norm of η_k+1). In particular, when operatornameHessF ()_x is positive deﬁnite and η_k+1 lies outside the trust region, the solution to the trust-region problem must lie on the trust-region boundary. Thus, there is no reason to continue with the conjugate gradient iteration, as it stands, as subsequent iterates will move further outside the trust-region boundary.
