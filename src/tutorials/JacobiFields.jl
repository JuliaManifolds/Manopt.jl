# # Illustration of Jacobi Fields
#
# This tutorial illustrates the usage of Jacobi Fields within
# `Manopt.jl`.
# For this tutorial you should be familiar with the basic terminology on a
# manifold like the exponential and logarithmic map as well as
# [shortest geodesic](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html#ManifoldsBase.shortest_geodesic-Tuple{Manifold,Any,Any})s.

# where $x$ is on the left. Then this tutorial solves the following task:
#
# Given a direction $X_p∈ T_x\mathcal M$, for example
X = [0.0, 0.4, 0.5]
# we move the start point $x$ into, how does any point on the geodesic move?
#
# Or mathematically: Compute $D_p g(t; p,q)$ for some fixed $t∈[0,1]$
# and a given direction $X_p$.
# Of course two cases are quite easy: For $t=0$ we are in $x$ and how $x$ “moves”
# is already known, so $D_x g(0;p,q) = X$. On the other side, for $t=1$,
# $g(1; p,q) = q$ which is fixed, so $D_p g(1; p,q)$ is the zero tangent vector
# (in $T_q\mathcal M$).
#
# For all other cases we employ a [`jacobi_field`](@ref), which is a (tangent)
# vector field along the [shortest geodesic](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html#ManifoldsBase.shortest_geodesic-Tuple{Manifold,Any,Any}) given as follows: The _geodesic variation_
# $\Gamma_{g,X}(s,t)$ is defined for some $\varepsilon > 0$ as
# ````math
# \Gamma_{g,X}(s,t):=\exp{\gamma_{p,X}(s)}[t\log_{g(s;p,X)}p],\qquad s∈(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon),\ t∈[0,1].
# ````
# Intuitively we make a small step $s$ into direction $\xi$ using the geodesic
# $g(\cdot; p,X)$ and from $r=g(s; p,X)$ we follow (in $t$) the geodesic
# $g(\cdot; r,q)$. The corresponding Jacobi field $J_{g,X}$
# along $g(\cdot; p,q)$ is given by
#
# ````math
# J_{g,X}(t):=\frac{D}{\partial s}\Gamma_{g,X}(s,t)\Bigl\rvert_{s=0}
# ````
#
# which is an ODE and we know the boundary conditions $J_{g,X}(0)=X$ and
# $J_{g,X}(t) = 0$. In symmetric spaces we can compute the solution, since the
# system of ODEs decouples, see for example [do Carmo](#doCarmo1992),
# Chapter 4.2. Within `Manopt.jl` this is implemented as
# [`jacobi_field`](@ref)`(M,p,q,t,X[,β])`, where the optional parameter (function)
# `β` specifies, which Jacobi field we want to evaluate and the one used here is
# the default.
#
# We can hence evaluate that on the points on the geodesic at
T = [0:0.1:1.0...]
