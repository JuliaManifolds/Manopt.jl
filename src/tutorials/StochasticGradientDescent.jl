# # [Stochastic Gradient Descent](@id SGDTutorial)
#
# This tutorial illustrates how to use the [`stochastic_gradient_descent`](@ref)
# solver and different [`DirectionUpdateRule`](@ref)s in order to introduce
# the average or momentum variant, see [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent).
#
# Computationally we look at a very simple but large scale problem,
# the Riemannian Center of Mass or [Fréchet mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fréchet_mean):
# For given points ``p_i \in \mathcal M``, ``i=1,\ldots,N`` this optimization problem reads
#
# ```math
# \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{x\in\mathcal M} \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
#   \operatorname{d}^2_{\mathcal M}(x,p_i),
# ```
# which of course can be (and is) solved by a gradient descent, see the [introductionary tutorial](@ref Optimize).
# If ``N`` is very large it might be quite expensive to evaluate the complete gradient.
# A remedy is, to evaluate only one of the terms at a time and choose a random order for these.
#
# We first initialize the manifold (see [])

# Note that due to the construction of the points as zero mean tangent vectors, the mean should
# be very close to our initial point `x`.
#
# In order to use the stochastic gradient, we now need a function that returns the vector of gradients.
# There are two ways to define it in `Manopt.jl`: as one function, that returns a vector or a vector of funtions.
#
# The first variant is of course easier to define, but the second is more efficient when only evaluating one of the gradients.
# For the mean we have as a gradient
#
# ```math
#  ∇F(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N ∇f_i(x) \quad \text{where} ∇f_i(x) = -\log_x p_i
# ```
#
# Which we define as
F(x) = 1 / (2 * n) * sum(map(p -> distance(M, x, p)^2, data))
∇F(x) = [∇distance(M, p, x) for p in data]
∇f = [x -> ∇distance(M, p, x) for p in data];
# The calls are only slightly different, but notice that accessing the 2nd gradient element
# requires evaluating all logs in the first function.
# So while you can use both `∇F` and `∇f` in the following call, the second one is faster:
@time x_opt1 = stochastic_gradient_descent(M, ∇F, x);
# versus
@time x_opt2 = stochastic_gradient_descent(M, ∇f, x);
# This result is reasonably close. But we can improve it by using a [`DirectionUpdateRule`](@ref),
# namely:
# On the one hand [`MomentumGradient`](@ref), which requires both the manifold and the initial value,
#    in order to keep track of the iterate and parallel transport the last direction to the current iterate.
#    you can also set a `vector_transport_method`, if `ParallelTransport()` is not
#    available on your manifold. Here we simply do
@time x_opt3 = stochastic_gradient_descent(
    M, ∇f, x; direction=MomentumGradient(M, x, StochasticGradient())
);
# And on the other hand the [`AverageGradient`](@ref) computes an average of the last `n` gradients, i.e.
@time x_opt4 = stochastic_gradient_descent(
    M, ∇f, x; direction=AverageGradient(M, x, 10, StochasticGradient())
);
# note that the default [`StoppingCriterion`](@ref) is a fixed number of iterations.
#
# Note that since you can apply both also in case of [`gradient_descent`](@ref),
# i.e. to use [`IdentityUpdateRule`](@ref) and evaluate the classical gradient,
# both constructors have to know that internally the default evaluation of the Stochastic gradient
# (choosing one gradient $∇f_k$ at random) has to be specified.
#
# For this small example you can of course also use a gradient descent with [`ArmijoLinesearch`](@ref),
# but it will be a little slower usually
@time x_opt5 = gradient_descent(M, F, x -> sum(∇F(x)), x; stepsize=ArmijoLinesearch());
# but it is for sure faster than the variant above that evaluates the full gradient on every iteration,
# since stochastic gradient descent takes more iterations.
#
# Note that all 5 of couse yield the same result
