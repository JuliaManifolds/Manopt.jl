"""
    Problem{T}

Describe the problem that should be optimized by stating all properties, that do not change
during an optimization or that are dependent of a certain solver.

The parameter `T` can be used to distinguish problems with different representations
or implementations.
The default parameter [`AllocatingEvaluation`](@ref), which might be slower but easier to use.
The usually faster parameter value is [`MutatingEvaluation`](@ref)

See [`Options`](@ref) for the changing and solver dependent properties.

    AbstractEvaluationType

An abstract type to specify the kind of evaluation a [`Problem`](@ref) supports.

"""
    AllocatingEvaluation <: AbstractEvaluationType

A parameter for a [`Problem`](@ref) indicating that the problem uses functions that
allocate memory for their result, i.e. they work out of place.

A parameter for a [`Problem`](@ref) indicating that the problem uses functions that
do not allocate memory but work on their input, i.e. in place.

evaluate the cost function `F` stored within a [`Problem`](@ref) at the point `x`.
