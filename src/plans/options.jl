@doc doc""" 
    StoppingCriterion

An abstract type for the functors representing stoping criteria, i.e. they are
callable structures. The naming Scheme follows functions, see for
example [`stopAfterIteration`](@ref).

Every StoppingCriterion has to provide a constructor and its function has to have
the interface `(p,o,i)` where a [`Problem`](@ref) as well as [`Options`](@ref)
and the current number of iterations are the arguments and returns a Bool whether
to stop or not.

By default each `StoppingCriterion` should provide a fiels `reason` to provide
details when a criteion is met (and that is empty otherwise).

    Stepsize

An abstract type for the functors representing step sizes, i.e. they are callable
structurs. The naming scheme is `TypeOfStepSize`, e.g. `ConstantStepsize`.

Every Stepsize has to provide a constructor and its function has to have
the interface `(p,o,i)` where a [`Problem`](@ref) as well as [`Options`](@ref)
and the current number of iterations are the arguments
and returns a number, namely the stepsize to use.
