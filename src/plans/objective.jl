    AbstractManifoldObjective{T<:AbstractEvaluationType}

Describe the collection of the optimization function ``f\colon \mathcal M â†’ \bbR` (or even a vectorial range)
and its corresponding elements, which might for example be a gradient or (one or more) prxomial maps.

All these elements should usually be implemented as functions
`(M, p) -> ...`, or `(M, X, p) -> ...` that is

* the first argument of these functions should be the manifold `M` they are defined on
* the argument `X` is present, if the computation is performed inplace of `X` (see [`InplaceEvaluation`](@ref))
* the argument `p` is the place the function (``f`` or one of its elements) is evaluated __at__.

the type `T` indicates the global [`AbstractEvaluationType`](@ref).
