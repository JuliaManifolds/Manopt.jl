For a function $f: ℳ → ℝ$  that maps from a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold)
ℳ to the real line, we aim to solve

> Find the minimizer p on ℳ, i.e. the (or a) point where f attains its minimum.

`Manopt.jl` provides

* A framework to implement arbitrary optimization algorithms on Riemannian Manifolds
* A library of optimization algorithms on Riemannian manifolds
* an easy-to-use interface for (debug) output and recording values during an algorithm run.
* several tools to investigate the algorithms, gradients, and optimality criteria

## Getting started

In Julia you can get started by just typing

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("Manopt");
```

and then checkout the [Get Started: Optimize!](https://manoptjl.org/stable/tutorials/Optimize!/) tutorial.

## Related packages

Manopt.jl is based on [`ManifoldsBase.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldsBase.jl/stable/),
hence the algorithms can be used with _any_ manifold following this interface for defining
a Riemannian manifold.

The following packages are related to `Manopt.jl`

* [`Manifolds.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/) – a library of manifolds implemented using [`ManifoldsBase.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldsBase.jl/stable/) :octocat: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/Manifolds.jl)
* [`ManifoldsDiff.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldDiff.jl/stable/) – a package to use (Euclidean) AD tools on manifolds, that also provides several differentials and gradients. :octocat: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/ManifoldDiff.jl)
