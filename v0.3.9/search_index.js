Indeed, m_x() is unbounded from below along the line η_k + α δ_k. If our aim is to minimize the model within the trust-region, it makes far more sense to reduce m_x() along η_k + α δ_k as much as we can while staying within the trust-region, and this means moving to the trust-region boundary along this line. Thus when κ  0 at iteration k, we replace α = fracr_k z_k_xκ with τ described as above. The other possibility is that η_k+1 would lie outside the trust-region at iteration k (i.e. η_k η_k_x^*   Δ^2 what can be identified with the norm of η_k+1). In particular, when operatornameHessF ()_x is positive deﬁnite and η_k+1 lies outside the trust region, the solution to the trust-region problem must lie on the trust-region boundary. Thus, there is no reason to continue with the conjugate gradient iteration, as it stands, as subsequent iterates will move further outside the trust-region boundary.

The two-loop recursion can be understood as that the InverseBFGS update is executed m times in a row on mathcalB^(0)_k using the tangent vectors  widetildes_i widetildey_i_i=k-m^k-1, and in the same time the resulting operator mathcalB^LRBFGS_k  is directly applied on operatornamegradf(x_k). When updating there are two cases: if there is still free memory, i.e. k  m, the previously stored vector pairs  widetildes_i widetildey_i_i=k-m^k-1 have to be transported into the upcoming tangent space T_x_k+1 mathcalM; if there is no free memory, the oldest pair  widetildes_km widetildey_km has to be discarded and then all the remaining vector pairs  widetildes_i widetildey_i_i=k-m+1^k-1 are transported into the tangent space T_x_k+1 mathcalM. After that we calculate and store s_k = widetildes_k = T^S_x_k α_k η_k(α_k η_k) and y_k = widetildey_k. This process ensures that new information about the objective function is always included and the old, probably no longer relevant, information is discarded.\n\nFields\n\nmethod – the maximum number of vector pairs stored.\nmemory_s – the set of the stored (and transported) search directions times step size  widetildes_i_i=k-m^k-1.\nmemory_y – set of the stored gradient differences  widetildey_i_i=k-m^k-1.\nξ – a variable used in the two-loop recursion.\nρ – a variable used in the two-loop recursion.\nscale –\nvector_transport_method – a AbstractVectorTransportMethod\n\nSee also\n\nInverseBFGS QuasiNewtonCautiousDirectionUpdate AbstractQuasiNewtonDirectionUpdate\n\n[HuangGallivanAbsil2015]: Huang, Wen and Gallivan, K.
