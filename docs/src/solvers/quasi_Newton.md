## Background

The aim is to minimize a real-valued function on a Riemannian manifold, that is

```math
\min f(x), \quad x ∈ \mathcal{M}.
```

Riemannian quasi-Newtonian methods are as generalizations of their Euclidean counterparts Riemannian line search methods. These methods determine a search direction ``η_k ∈ T_{x_k} \mathcal{M}`` at the current iterate ``x_k`` and a suitable stepsize ``α_k`` along ``\gamma(α) = R_{x_k}(α η_k)``, where ``R: T \mathcal{M} →\mathcal{M}`` is a retraction. The next iterate is obtained by

```math
x_{k+1} = R_{x_k}(α_k η_k).
```

In quasi-Newton methods, the search direction is given by

```math
η_k = -{\mathcal{H}_k}^{-1}[\operatorname{grad}f (x_k)] = -\mathcal{B}_k [\operatorname{grad} (x_k)],
```

where ``\mathcal{H}_k : T_{x_k} \mathcal{M} →T_{x_k} \mathcal{M}`` is a positive definite self-adjoint operator, which approximates the action of the Hessian ``\operatorname{Hess} f (x_k)[⋅]`` and ``\mathcal{B}_k = {\mathcal{H}_k}^{-1}``. The idea of quasi-Newton methods is instead of creating a complete new approximation of the Hessian operator ``\operatorname{Hess} f(x_{k+1})`` or its inverse at every iteration, the previous operator ``\mathcal{H}_k`` or ``\mathcal{B}_k`` is updated by a convenient formula using the obtained information about the curvature of the objective function during the iteration. The resulting operator ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}`` acts on the tangent space ``T_{x_{k+1}} \mathcal{M}`` of the freshly computed iterate ``x_{k+1}``.
In order to get a well-defined method, the following requirements are placed on the new operator ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}`` that is created by an update.
Since the Hessian ``\operatorname{Hess} f(x_{k+1})`` is a self-adjoint operator on the tangent space ``T_{x_{k+1}} \mathcal{M}``, and ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` approximates it, one requirement is, that ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}`` is also self-adjoint on ``T_{x_{k+1}} \mathcal{M}``.
In order to achieve a steady descent, the next requirement is that ``η_k`` is a descent direction in each iteration.
Hence a further requirement is that ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}`` is a positive definite operator on ``T_{x_{k+1}} \mathcal{M}``.
In order to get information about the curvature of the objective function into the new operator ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}``, the last requirement is a form of a Riemannian quasi-Newton equation:

```math
\mathcal{H}_{k+1} [T_{x_k \rightarrow x_{k+1}}({R_{x_k}}^{-1}(x_{k+1}))] = \operatorname{grad}(x_{k+1}) - T_{x_k \rightarrow x_{k+1}}(\operatorname{grad}f(x_k))
```

or

```math
\mathcal{B}_{k+1} [\operatorname{grad}f(x_{k+1}) - T_{x_k \rightarrow x_{k+1}}(\operatorname{grad}f(x_k))] = T_{x_k \rightarrow x_{k+1}}({R_{x_k}}^{-1}(x_{k+1}))
```

where ``T_{x_k \rightarrow x_{k+1}} : T_{x_k} \mathcal{M} →T_{x_{k+1}} \mathcal{M}`` and
the chosen retraction ``R`` is the associated retraction of ``T``.
Note that, of course, not all updates in all situations meet these conditions in every iteration.
For specific quasi-Newton updates, the fulfilment of the Riemannian curvature condition, which requires that

```math
g_{x_{k+1}}(s_k, y_k) > 0
```

holds, is a requirement for the inheritance of the self-adjointness and positive definiteness of the ``\mathcal{H}_k`` or ``\mathcal{B}_k`` to the operator ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}``. Unfortunately, the fulfilment of the Riemannian curvature condition is not given by a step size ``\alpha_k > 0`` that satisfies the generalized Wolfe conditions. However, to create a positive definite operator ``\mathcal{H}_{k+1}`` or ``\mathcal{B}_{k+1}`` in each iteration, the so-called locking condition was introduced in [HuangGallivanAbsil:2015](@cite), which requires that the isometric vector transport ``T^S``, which is used in the update formula, and its associate retraction ``R`` fulfil

```math
T^{S}{x, ξ_x}(ξ_x) = β T^{R}{x, ξ_x}(ξ_x), \quad β = \frac{\lVert ξ_x \rVert_x}{\lVert T^{R}{x, ξ_x}(ξ_x) \rVert_{R_{x}(ξ_x)}},
```

where ``T^R`` is the vector transport by differentiated retraction. With the requirement that the isometric vector transport ``T^S`` and its associated retraction ``R`` satisfies the locking condition and using the tangent vector

```math
y_k = {β_k}^{-1} \operatorname{grad}f(x_{k+1}) - T^{S}{x_k, α_k η_k}(\operatorname{grad}f(x_k)),
```

where

```math
β_k = \frac{\lVert α_k η_k \rVert_{x_k}}{\lVert T^{R}{x_k, α_k η_k}(α_k η_k) \rVert_{x_{k+1}}},
```

in the update, it can be shown that choosing a stepsize ``α_k > 0`` that satisfies the Riemannian Wolfe conditions leads to the fulfilment of the Riemannian curvature condition, which in turn implies that the operator generated by the updates is positive definite.
In the following the specific operators are denoted in matrix notation and hence use ``H_k`` and ``B_k``, respectively.

## Direction updates

## State

The quasi Newton algorithm is based on a [`DefaultManoptProblem`](@ref).

## [Technical details](@id sec-qn-technical-details)

The [`quasi_Newton`](@ref) solver requires the following functions of a manifold to be available

* A [`retract!`](@extref ManifoldsBase :doc:`retractions`)`(M, q, p, X)`; it is recommended to set the [`default_retraction_method`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.default_retraction_method-Tuple{AbstractManifold}`) to a favourite retraction. If this default is set, a `retraction_method=` does not have to be specified.
* A [`vector_transport_to!`](@extref ManifoldsBase :doc:`vector_transports`)`M, Y, p, X, q)`; it is recommended to set the [`default_vector_transport_method`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.default_vector_transport_method-Tuple{AbstractManifold}`) to a favourite retraction. If this default is set, a `vector_transport_method=` or `vector_transport_method_dual=` (for ``\mathcal N``) does not have to be specified.
* By default quasi Newton uses [`ArmijoLinesearch`](@ref) which requires [`max_stepsize`](@ref)`(M)` to be set and an implementation of [`inner`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.inner-Tuple{AbstractManifold, Any, Any, Any}`)`(M, p, X)`.
* the [`norm`](@extref `LinearAlgebra.norm-Tuple{AbstractManifold, Any, Any}`) as well, to stop when the norm of the gradient is small, but if you implemented `inner`, the norm is provided already.
* A [`copyto!`](@extref `Base.copyto!-Tuple{AbstractManifold, Any, Any}`)`(M, q, p)` and [`copy`](@extref `Base.copy-Tuple{AbstractManifold, Any}`)`(M,p)` for points and similarly `copy(M, p, X)` for tangent vectors.
* By default the tangent vector storing the gradient is initialized calling [`zero_vector`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.zero_vector-Tuple{AbstractManifold, Any}`)`(M,p)`.

Most Hessian approximations further require [`get_coordinates`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.get_coordinates`)`(M, p, X, b)` with respect to the [`AbstractBasis`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.AbstractBasis`) `b` provided, which is [`DefaultOrthonormalBasis`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.DefaultOrthonormalBasis`) by default from the `basis=` keyword.
