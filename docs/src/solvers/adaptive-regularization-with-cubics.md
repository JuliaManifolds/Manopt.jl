## State

## Sub solvers

There are several ways to approach the subsolver. The default is the first one.

## Lanczos Iteration

```@docs
Manopt.LanczosState
```

## (Conjugate) Gradient Descent

There is a generic objective, that implements the sub problem

```@docs
AdaptiveRagularizationWithCubicsModelObjective
```

Since the sub problem is given on the tangent space, you have to provide

```
arc_obj = AdaptiveRagularizationWithCubicsModelObjective(mho, Ïƒ)
sub_problem = DefaultProblem(TangentSpaceAt(M,p), arc_obj)
```

where `mho` is the hessian objective of `f` to solve.
Then use this for the `sub_problem` keyword
and use your favourite gradient based solver for the `sub_state` keyword, for example a
[`ConjugateGradientDescentState`](@ref)
