# Notation

In this package, we follow the notation introduced in [Manifolds.jl – Notation](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/latest/misc/notation.html)

with the following additional or slightly changed notation

| Symbol | Description | Also used | Comment |
|:--:|:--------------- |:--:|:-- |
| ``∇`` | The [Levi-Cevita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection) | | |
| ``\operatorname{grad}f`` | The Riemannian gradient | ``∇f``| due to possible confusion with the connection, we try to avoid ``∇f`` |
| ``\operatorname{Hess}f``| The Riemannian Hessian | |
