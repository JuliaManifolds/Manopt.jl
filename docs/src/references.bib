The resulting curve is obtained in such a way that its mean squared acceleration is minimal in addition to remaining close the data points. We approximate the acceleration by discretizing the squared second order derivative along the curve. We derive a closed-form, numerically stable and efficient algorithm to compute the gradient of a B\'ezier curve on manifolds with respect to its control points, expressed as a concatenation of so-called adjoint Jacobi fields. Several examples illustrate the capabilites and validity of this approach both for interpolation and approximation. The examples also illustrate that the approach outperforms previous works tackling this problem.},

The linear independence, Mangasarian-Fromovitz, and Abadie constraint qualifications are also formulated, and the chain ``LICQ implies MFCQ implies ACQ implies GCQ'' is proved. Moreover, classical connections between these constraint qualifications and the set of Lagrange multipliers are established, which parallel the results in Euclidean space. The constrained Riemannian center of mass on the sphere serves as an illustrating numerical example.},

This text introduces the differential geometry and Riemannian geometry concepts that will help students and researchers in applied mathematics, computer science and engineering gain a firm mathematical grounding to use these tools confidently in their research. Its charts-last approach will prove more intuitive from an optimizer's viewpoint, and all definitions and theorems are motivated to build time-tested optimization algorithms. Starting from first principles, the text goes on to cover current research on topics including worst-case complexity and geodesic convexity. Readers will appreciate the tricks of the trade for conducting research and for numerical implementations sprinkled throughout the book.},

Equivalence between the classical and a simplified Riemannian version of the DCA is stablished. We also prove that under mild assumptions the Riemannian version of the DCA is well defined and every cluster point of the sequence generated by the proposed method, if any, is a critical point of the objective DC function. Some duality relations between the DC problem and its dual are also established. Applications to the problem of maximizing a convex function in a compact set and manifold-valued image denoising are presented in the DC context.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we comparatively analyze the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) geometry with the popular Affine-Invariant (AI) geometry for Riemannian optimization on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix manifold. Our study begins with an observation that the BW metric has a linear dependence on SPD matrices in contrast to the quadratic dependence of the AI metric. We build on this to show that the BW metric is a more suitable and robust choice for several Riemannian optimization problems over ill-conditioned SPD matrices. We show that the BW geometry has a non-negative curvature, which further improves convergence rates of algorithms over the non-positively curved AI geometry. Finally, we verify that several popular cost functions, which are known to be geodesic convex under the AI geometry, are also geodesic convex under the BW geometry. Extensive experiments on various applications support our findings.},

We explore the generalization of the BW geometry in three different ways: 1) by generalizing the Lyapunov operator in the metric, 2) by generalizing the orthogonal Procrustes distance, and 3) by generalizing the Wasserstein distance between the Gaussians. We show that they all lead to the same geometry. The proposed generalization is parameterized by a symmetric positive definite matrix \$\textbackslash mathbf\{M\}\$ such that when \$\textbackslash mathbf\{M\} = \textbackslash mathbf\{I\}\$, we recover the BW geometry. We derive expressions for the distance, geodesic, exponential/logarithm maps, Levi-Civita connection, and sectional curvature under the generalized BW geometry. We also present applications and experiments that illustrate the efficacy of the proposed geometry.},
