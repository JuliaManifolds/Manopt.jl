For a function ``f:\mathcal M → ℝ`` defined on a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold) ``\mathcal M`` we aim to solve

```math
\operatorname*{argmin}_{p ∈ \mathcal M} f(p),
```

or in other words: find the point ``p`` on the manifold, where ``f`` reaches its minimal function value.

`Manopt.jl` provides a framework for optimization on manifolds as well as a Library of optimization algorithms in [Julia](https://julialang.org).
It belongs to the “Manopt family”, which includes [Manopt](https://manopt.org) (Matlab) and [pymanopt.org](https://www.pymanopt.org/) (Python).

If you want to delve right into `Manopt.jl` check out the
[Get started: Optimize!](tutorials/Optimize!.md) tutorial.

`Manopt.jl` makes it easy to use an algorithm for your favourite
manifold as well as a manifold for your favourite algorithm. It already provides
many manifolds and algorithms, which can easily be enhanced, for example to
[record](@ref RecordSection) certain data or
[debug output](@ref DebugSection) throughout iterations.

## Main Features

### Optimization Algorithms (Solvers)

For every optimization algorithm, a [solver](@ref SolversSection) is implemented based on a [`AbstractManoptProblem`](@ref) that describes the problem to solve and its [`AbstractManoptSolverState`](@ref) that set up the solver, store interims values. Together they
form a [plan](@ref planSection).

## Manifolds

This project is build upon [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/interface.html), a generic interface to implement manifolds. Certain functions are extended for specific manifolds from [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/), but all other manifolds from that package can be used here, too.

The notation in the documentation aims to follow the same [notation](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/notation.html) from these packages.

### Functions on Manifolds

Several functions are available, implemented on an arbitrary manifold, [cost functions](@ref CostFunctions), [differentials](@ref DifferentialFunctions) and their [adjoints](@ref adjointDifferentialFunctions), and [gradients](@ref GradientFunctions) as well as [proximal maps](@ref proximalMapFunctions).

### Visualization

To visualize and interpret results, `Manopt.jl` aims to provide both easy plot functions as well as [exports](@ref Exports). Furthermore a system to get [debug](@ref DebugSection) during the iterations of an algorithms as well as [record](@ref RecordSection) capabilities, i.e. to record a specified tuple of values per iteration, most prominently [`RecordCost`](@ref) and
[`RecordIterate`](@ref). Take a look at the [Get Started: Optimize!](tutorials/Optimize!.md) tutorial on how to easily activate this.

## Literature

If you want to get started with manifolds, one book is [doCarmo:1992](@cite),
and if you want do directly dive into optimization on manifolds, good references are
[AbsilMahonySepulchre:2008](@cite) and [Boumal:2023](@cite),
which are both available online for free
