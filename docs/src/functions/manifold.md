# Specific manifold functions

This small section extends the functions available from [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldsBase.jl/stable/) and [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/), especially a few random generators, that are simpler than the available functions.
