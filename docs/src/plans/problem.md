# [A Manopt Problem](@id ProblemSection)

```@meta
CurrentModule = Manopt
```

A problem describes all static data of an optimisation task and has as a super type

```@docs
AbstractManoptProblem
get_objective
get_manifold
```

Usually, such a problem is determined by the manifold or domain of the optimisation and the objective with all its properties used within an algorithm â€“ see [The Objective](@ref ObjectiveSection). For that we can just use

```@docs
DefaultManoptProblem
```

The exception to these are the primal dual-based solvers ([Chambolle-Pock](@ref ChambollePockSolver) and the [PD Semismooth Newton](@ref PDRSSNSolver)]), which both need two manifolds as their domain(s), hence there also exists a
