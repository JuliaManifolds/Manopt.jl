In order to start a solver, both a [Problem](@ref ProblemSection) and [Options](@ref OptionsSection) are required.
Together they form a __plan__.
Everything related to problems, options and their tools in general are explained in this
section and its subpages. The specific Options related to a certain (concrete) solver can be
found on the specific solver page, see [The solvers overview](@ref SolversSection).
