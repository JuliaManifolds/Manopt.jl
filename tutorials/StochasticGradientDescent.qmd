This tutorial illustrates how to use the [`stochastic_gradient_descent`](https://manoptjl.org/stable/solvers/stochastic_gradient_descent.html)
solver and different [`DirectionUpdateRule`](https://manoptjl.org/stable/solvers/gradient_descent.html#Direction-Update-Rules-1)s to introduce
the average or momentum variant, see [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent).

Computationally, we look at a very simple but large scale problem,
the Riemannian Center of Mass or [Fréchet mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fréchet_mean):
for given points ``` ``p_i ∈\mathcal M``, ``i=1,…,N`` ```{=commonmark} this optimization problem reads

```math
\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{x∈\mathcal M} \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
  \operatorname{d}^2_{\mathcal M}(x,p_i),
```

which of course can be (and is) solved by a gradient descent, see the introductory
tutorial or [Statistics in Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/features/statistics.html).
If $N$ is very large, evaluating the complete gradient might be quite expensive.
A remedy is to evaluate only one of the terms at a time and choose a random order for these.

We first initialize the packages

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false
using Pkg;
cd(@__DIR__)
Pkg.activate("."); # for reproducibility use the local tutorial environment.
```

```{julia}
using Manifolds, Manopt, Random, BenchmarkTools, ManifoldDiff
using ManifoldDiff: grad_distance
Random.seed!(42);
```


We next generate a (little) large(r) data set

```{julia}
n = 5000
σ = π / 12
M = Sphere(2)
p = 1 / sqrt(2) * [1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
data = [exp(M, p,  σ * rand(M; vector_at=p)) for i in 1:n];
```

Note that due to the construction of the points as zero mean tangent vectors, the mean should
be very close to our initial point `p`.

In order to use the stochastic gradient, we now need a function that returns the vector of gradients.
There are two ways to define it in `Manopt.jl`: either as a single function that returns a vector, or as a vector of functions.

The first variant is of course easier to define, but the second is more efficient when only evaluating one of the gradients.

For the mean, the gradient is

```math
\operatorname{grad}f(p) = \sum_{i=1}^N \operatorname{grad}f_i(x) \quad \text{where} \operatorname{grad}f_i(x) = -\log_x p_i
```

which we define in `Manopt.jl` in two different ways:
either as one function returning all gradients as a vector (see `gradF`), or, maybe more fitting for a large scale problem, as a vector of small gradient functions (see `gradf`)


```{julia}
F(M, p) = 1 / (2 * n) * sum(map(q -> distance(M, p, q)^2, data))
gradF(M, p) = [grad_distance(M, p, q) for q in data]
gradf = [(M, p) -> grad_distance(M, q, p) for q in data];
p0 = 1 / sqrt(3) * [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
```

The calls are only slightly different, but notice that accessing the second gradient element
requires evaluating all logs in the first function, while we only call _one_
of the functions in the second array of functions.
So while you can use both `gradF` and `gradf` in the following call, the second one is (much) faster:

```{julia}
p_opt1 = stochastic_gradient_descent(M, gradF, p)
```
```{julia}
@benchmark stochastic_gradient_descent($M, $gradF, $p0)
```
```{julia}
p_opt2 = stochastic_gradient_descent(M, gradf, p0)
```
```{julia}
@benchmark stochastic_gradient_descent($M, $gradf, $p0)
```


This result is reasonably close. But we can improve it by using a `DirectionUpdateRule`, namely:

On the one hand [`MomentumGradient`](@ref), which requires both the manifold and the initial value, to keep track of the iterate and parallel transport the last direction to the current iterate.
The necessary `vector_transport_method` keyword is set to a suitable default on every manifold,
see ``[`default_vector_transport_method`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.default_vector_transport_method-Tuple{AbstractManifold}`)``{=commonmark}. We get
"""

```{julia}
p_opt3 = stochastic_gradient_descent(
    M, gradf, p0; direction=MomentumGradient(; direction=StochasticGradient())
)
```

```{julia}
MG = MomentumGradient(; direction=StochasticGradient());
@benchmark stochastic_gradient_descent($M, $gradf, p=$p0; direction=$MG)
```

And on the other hand the [`AverageGradient`](https://manoptjl.org/stable/solvers/gradient_descent.html#Manopt.AverageGradient) computes an average of the last `n` gradients. This is done by

```{julia}
p_opt4 = stochastic_gradient_descent(
    M, gradf, p0; direction=AverageGradient(; n=10, direction=StochasticGradient()), debug=[],
)
```
```{julia}
AG = AverageGradient(; n=10, direction=StochasticGradient(M));
@benchmark stochastic_gradient_descent($M, $gradf, p=$p0; direction=$AG, debug=[])
```

Note that the default `StoppingCriterion` is a fixed number of iterations which helps the comparison here.

For both update rules we have to internally specify that we are still in the stochastic setting,
since both rules can also be used with the `IdentityUpdateRule` within [`gradient_descent`](file:///Users/ronny/Repositories/Julia/Manopt.jl/docs/build/solvers/gradient_descent.html).

For this not-that-large-scale example we can of course also use a gradient descent with `ArmijoLinesearch`,

```{julia}
fullGradF(M, p) = 1/n*sum(grad_distance(M, q, p) for q in data)
p_opt5 = gradient_descent(M, F, fullGradF, p0; stepsize=ArmijoLinesearch())
```

but in general it is expected to be a bit slow.

```{julia}
AL = ArmijoLinesearch();
@benchmark gradient_descent($M, $F, $fullGradF, $p0; stepsize=$AL)
```
