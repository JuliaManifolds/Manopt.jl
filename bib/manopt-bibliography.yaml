    We derive a variational model to fit a composite Bézier curve to a set of
    data points on a Riemannian manifold. The resulting curve is obtained in
    such a way that its mean squared acceleration is minimal in addition to
    remaining close the data points. We approximate the acceleration by
    discretizing the squared second order derivative along the curve. We derive
    a closed-form, numerically stable and efficient algorithm to compute the
    gradient of a Bézier curve on manifolds with respect to its control points,
    expressed as a concatenation of so-called adjoint Jacobi fields. Several
    examples illustrate the capabilites and validity of this approach both for
    interpolation and approximation. The examples also illustrate that the
    approach outperforms previous works tackling this problem.

    Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for equality and inequality constrained
    optimization problems on smooth manifolds are formulated. Under the Guignard
    constraint qualification, local minimizers are shown to admit Lagrange
    multipliers. The linear independence, Mangasarian-Fromovitz, and Abadie
    constraint qualifications are also formulated, and the chain “LICQ implies
    MFCQ implies ACQ implies GCQ” is proved. Moreover, classical connections
    between these constraint qualifications and the set of Lagrange multipliers
    are established, which parallel the results in Euclidean space. The
    constrained Riemannian center of mass on the sphere serves as an
    illustrating numerical example.

    In this paper we propose a Riemannian version of the difference of convex
    algorithm (DCA) to solve a minimization problem involving the difference of
    convex (DC) function. Equivalence between the classical and a simplified
    Riemannian version of the DCA is stablished. We also prove that under mild
    assumptions the Riemannian version of the DCA is well defined and every
    cluster point of the sequence generated by the proposed method, if any, is a
    critical point of the objective DC function. Some duality relations between
    the DC problem and its dual are also established. Applications to the
    problem of maximizing a convex function in a compact set and manifold-valued
    image denoising are presented in the DC context.

    In this paper, we comparatively analyze the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) geometry
    with the popular Affine-Invariant (AI) geometry for Riemannian optimization
    on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix manifold. Our study begins
    with an observation that the BW metric has a linear dependence on SPD
    matrices in contrast to the quadratic dependence of the AI metric. We build
    on this to show that the BW metric is a more suitable and robust choice for
    several Riemannian optimization problems over ill-conditioned SPD matrices.
    We show that the BW geometry has a non-negative curvature, which further
    improves convergence rates of algorithms over the non-positively curved AI
    geometry. Finally, we verify that several popular cost functions, which are
    known to be geodesic convex under the AI geometry, are also geodesic convex
    under the BW geometry. Extensive experiments on various applications support
    our findings.

    This paper proposes a generalized Bures-Wasserstein (BW) Riemannian geometry
    for the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. We explore the
    generalization of the BW geometry in three different ways: 1) by
    generalizing the Lyapunov operator in the metric, 2) by generalizing the
    orthogonal Procrustes distance, and 3) by generalizing the Wasserstein
    distance between the Gaussians. We show that they all lead to the same
    geometry. The proposed generalization is parameterized by a symmetric
    positive definite matrix $\mathbf{M}$ such that when $\mathbf{M} =
    \mathbf{I}$, we recover the BW geometry. We derive expressions for the
    distance, geodesic, exponential/logarithm maps, Levi-Civita connection, and
    sectional curvature under the generalized BW geometry. We also present
    applications and experiments that illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
    geometry.
